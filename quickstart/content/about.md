My name is Augusto Peres. I studied mathematics at [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/pt/) and I am currently a researcher at [Inductiva Research Labs](https://inductiva.ai/) where I focus mainly on geometric deep learning and combinatorial optimization.

I am also deeply interested in generative AI, more specifically, text generation, image generation and text to image models.

### [Equivariant neural networks for recovery of Hadamard matrices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13157)

**Abstract**: We propose a message passing neural network architecture designed to be equivariant to column and row permutations of a matrix. We illustrate its advantages over traditional architectures like multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and even Transformers, on the combinatorial optimization task of recovering a set of deleted entries of a Hadamard matrix. We argue that this is a powerful application of the principles of Geometric Deep Learning to fundamental mathematics, and a potential stepping stone toward more insights on the Hadamard conjecture using Machine Learning techniques.

### [Bounded model checking distributed temporal logic](https://academic.oup.com/logcom/article-abstract/33/5/1022/6613020#no-access-message)

This work was published as the final result of my master's thesis.

**Abstract**: The distributed temporal logic (DTL) is a logic for reasoning about temporal properties of distributed systems from the local point of view of the system’s agents, which are assumed to execute sequentially and to interact by means of synchronous event sharing. Different versions of DTL have been proposed over the years for a number of different applications, reflecting different perspectives on how non-local information can be accessed by each agent. In a recent paper, an automata-theoretic approach to model check DTL was proposed Subtil et al. (2020, Technical Report). Herein, we follow a different approach and adapt the bounded model-checking (BMC) algorithm for linear temporal logic to the case of DTL (see Biere et al. (2003, Adv. Comput., 58, 117–148) and Biere et al. (1999, TACAS 1999, 193–207)). For that purpose, a new notion of bounded semantics for DTL is proposed. In the BMC approach, the witness problem is translated to the satisfiability of a propositional formula that can be addressed (efficiently) by SAT solvers. An important application for this approach is verification of security protocols (Basin et al. (2011, Theoret. Comput. Sci., 412, 4007–4043); Caleiro et al. (2005, Electron. Notes Theor. Comput. Sci., 125, 67–89)).
