My name is Augusto Peres. I studied mathematics at [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/pt/) and I am currently a researcher at [Inductiva Research Labs](https://inductiva.ai/) where I focus mainly on geometric deep learning and combinatorial optimization.

I am also deeply interested in generative AI, more specifically, text generation, image generation and text to image models.
